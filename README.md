## Contribution

I primarily worked on the **backend logic** of the chess system.  
This includes:

- Implementing **piece movement rules** in C++ (e.g., valid knight/bishop/queen moves)
- Handling **capture mechanics** (which pieces can capture which)
- Designing **win/loss conditions** (e.g., when checkmate or stalemate occurs)
- Managing **turn control** (e.g., black first vs white first toggle)
- Defining the overall **game state architecture** and rule flow

The logic is designed to be modular and clear, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience with rule consistency.
